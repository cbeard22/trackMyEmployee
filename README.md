## Description

This application allows the user to input the employees using node and inquirer to add roles and departments to their works database. The user can then track their salaries and view the employees departments. This will help supervisors keep track of their employees in one easy to use application. 

## Installation

  - First clone this repository to your local device and use VS code or another code editor for the next steps. 
  - Once you have opened the cloned folder in your code editer, make sure that you have node.js and My SQL installed on your computer. 
  - You will also need to create a ".env" file in VS Code or your choice of code editor that includes the link to your My SQL. Copy the following and paste in the .env file and enter your user and password information that you created when you installed My SQL: "DB_NAME=employee_trackerDB DB_USER= ???? DB_PASS= ?????"
  - You will then need to load the database into My SQL to initiate the connection. 
  - In VS Code or your choice of code editor, run "npm i" in the terminal to load the correct packages included from the cloned repository.

## Usage

  - Provided that you followed the steps in the installation process you will then open terminal in your code editor and enter "node app". This will start the inquirer prompts and you will be able to enter in the employee information.
